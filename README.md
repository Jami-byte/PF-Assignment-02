# PF Assignment 02 ‚Äì C Programming Tasks

This repository contains the second set of programming assignments for the **Programming Fundamentals** course. All programs are written in **C language** and aim to strengthen the core concepts of structured programming, problem-solving, and code modularity.

#Repository Overview

This repository includes six assignment codes stored in the `PF Assignment` folder. Each `.c` file represents a solution to a specific question or problem. Precompiled `.exe` files are also included for direct execution on Windows systems.

#Assignments

| Assignment                 | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Assignment 1st Code        | A program solving basic input/output or arithmetic problems.               |
| Assignment 2nd Code        | Introduces conditional logic, like if-else or switch-case structures.      |
| 3rd Code For Assignment    | Focuses on loops (for/while) and iterative constructs.                      |
| 4TH Code For Assignment    | Covers arrays and related operations.                                       |
| 5th Code For Assignment    | Demonstrates function-based design and modular code reuse.                 |
| 6th Code For Assignment    | Explores advanced concepts like pointers, structures, or file handling.     |

#Highlights

- **Step-by-step Learning**: Each assignment builds on concepts from the previous one.
- **Executable Files**: `.exe` files are provided for users who want to test the output without compiling.
- **Modular and Structured Code**: Encourages clean, reusable, and maintainable C code practices.

#Goals

- ‚úÖ Understand foundational C programming concepts
- ‚úÖ Practice control structures, loops, arrays, and functions
- ‚úÖ Get hands-on with pointers and structures
- ‚úÖ Improve code readability and modularity
- ‚úÖ Build a strong programming foundation for future projects and courses
